## Welcome

**Welcome to Town Hall**
Here is where we set community projects, pass laws and keep the treasury.

### Branches of Power

​	**The congress** is formed of all player-base with +50% support.
​	Each week a new set of Chiefs are elected, they are responsible with writing laws in a book & quill they can get from the secretary.

- Environment and zoning laws are written by the Chief of Environment;

- Player interaction by the Chief of Police;

- Building projects by the Chief of Infrastructure.

- Laws are passed by the congress +50% agreement of player-base.
  ​	

  ​	Breaking laws will get you taken to the congress to be judged else banned.

  ​	If all players can't start a trial the Chief of Police he can only report him and get him a temporary ban.

### Economy

​	There are 5 signs in the lobby, they are used for **community projects**.
​	A bounty is set for the projects by the congress.

​	Once the congress decides it has been completed, whomever did it receives the money.
> ​	*ex: "we need to make public wheat farm. Bounty: 100 RC"*

​	If there are more people working on a project and can't decide who gets what percentage they get none of the bounty.

​	**But how does RC gets it's value?**

​	Taxes in the form of iron gold or diamonds etc. are taxed from every player for each day you are on the server. 
​	You can postpone the payment until the next election.
​	The valuables are stored in the Treasury to form a spending budget.
​	For each iron, gold, diamond, etc. in the treasury there is an RC price and you can buy them with your RC giving it a stable value.
