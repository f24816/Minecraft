Here is where we set community projects to encourage players to help each other, pass laws to restrict players from doing undesirable things and exchange Redeemable Currency ( RC ) used at /playershops.

​	**The congress** is formed of all player-base.
​	Each week a new set of Chiefs are elected, they are responsible with writing laws in a book & quill and hiring people.

- Environment (animal, and non-renuables population) and zoning laws are written by the **Chief of Environment**; 

- Breaking Laws (murder, theft, griefing) by the **Chief of Police**; 

- Building projects by the **Chief of Infrastructure**. (he decides if community projects are eligible for bounty);

  

  ​	Laws are passed by the congress +50% agreement of player-base.
  
  ​	Breaking laws will get you taken to the congress to be judged else the Chief of Police can only report him and get him a temporary ban, until trial is started.

​	There are 5 signs in the lobby, they are used for **community projects**.
​	A bounty is set for these projects by the congress.
​	They are things that are done for everyone, roads, farms, structures.

​	Once the congress decides on a project, Chief of Infrastructure decides if it was completed, and reward the money.
> ​	*ex: "we need to make a road to the blaze farm. Bounty: 100 RC"*

​	If there are more people working on a project they have to write username and payment before they begin at Chief of Infrastructure. 
​	If they are more people and both want to work at a project the Chief of Infrastructure designates the people.

​	Taxes in the form of iron gold or diamonds etc. are taxed from every player for each day you are on the server.
​	The exchange NPC sets the value for RC, to get RC back to valuables we make a promise of 1 netherite for each 5000 RC.
​	You can postpone the payment of taxes until the next election.
